HEROES Academy Computer Science Cookbooks
=========================================

Welcome to the HEROES Cookbook.  For now, there is only the essentials of Python.

You should use these examples as part of your problem solving.  You should ask yourself
"what is it that I need to do?" and then find an example that does what you need to do.
Using that example as a guide, you can then write code that does what you want!
